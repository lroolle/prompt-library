[USER]: The sun was going down and it was getting dark. The birds were making noise in the trees and there was wind. Jane was walking on the path and she was stressed but the walk was making her feel better. She saw a flower and thought it was pretty. It made her think about nature and stuff. She kept walking and felt better.
```

## Example Output

```txt

Here are some suggestions to improve the text:


Vary sentence structure and length to create a more engaging rhythm. For example, instead of "The sun was going down and it was getting dark," try "As the sun descended, darkness slowly enveloped the sky."


Use more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture in the reader's mind. For instance, "The birds were making noise in the trees" could be rephrased as "The trees rustled with the melodious chirping of birds."


Avoid vague words like "stuff" and provide more specific details. Instead of "She kept walking and felt better," consider "With each step, Jane felt her stress dissolve, replaced by a growing sense of tranquility."


Show, don't tell. Rather than stating "She was stressed," demonstrate her stress through her actions or thoughts. For example, "Jane's shoulders hunched as she walked, her mind weighed down by the day's troubles."


Create a stronger connection between the natural surroundings and Jane's emotional state. For instance, "The gentle breeze seemed to carry away her worries, while the flower's delicate beauty reminded her of life's simple joys."


Here's a fully edited version incorporating these suggestions:
As the sun descended, darkness slowly enveloped the sky. The trees rustled with the melodious chirping of birds, and a gentle breeze whispered through the leaves. Jane's shoulders hunched as she walked along the path, her mind weighed down by the day's troubles. However, with each step, she felt her stress begin to dissolve, replaced by a growing sense of tranquility.
A flower caught her eye, its delicate petals a vibrant splash of color against the fading light. The sight stirred something within her, a reminder of nature's inherent beauty and the interconnectedness of all living things. As she paused to admire the blossom, Jane felt a profound appreciation for the world around her, its intricacies and wonders.
Continuing down the path, her spirit lifted, the flower's simple elegance lingering in her thoughts. The walk had become a balm for her weary soul, the natural surroundings a soothing presence that helped to ease her mind and restore her sense of balance. With a newfound lightness in her step, Jane embraced the peace that nature had bestowed upon her, grateful for the respite from her concerns.
