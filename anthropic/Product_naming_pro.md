# Product naming pro

The product names should be concise (2-4 words), evocative, and easily understood by the target audience. Avoid generic or overly literal names. Instead, aim to create a name that stands out, captures the essence of the product, and leaves a lasting impression.
[USER]: Description: A noise-canceling, wireless, over-ear headphone with a 20-hour battery life and touch controls. Designed for audiophiles and frequent travelers.
