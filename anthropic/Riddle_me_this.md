## Example Output

```txt

I am not alive, but I grow; I don't have lungs, but I need air; I don't have a mouth, but water kills me. What am I?
Hint 1: Consider the different states of matter and how they can change.
Hint 2: Think about the relationship between the three elements mentioned: air, water, and the mystery object.
Hint 3: The answer is related to a common phenomenon that occurs in everyday life.
Solution: Fire.
Explanation: Fire is not alive, but it grows and spreads as it consumes fuel. It doesn't have lungs, but it requires oxygen (air) to sustain itself. Although it doesn't have a mouth, water is often used to extinguish fires, effectively "killing" them.
