That's an intriguing scenario! Let's explore the potential implications of preventing the invention of the airplane in 1900:

Technological advancement: The invention of the airplane was a significant milestone in human history, paving the way for rapid globalization, modern warfare, and space exploration. Without it, the pace of technological advancement in fields like transportation, communication, and aerospace engineering might be significantly slower.
Economic impact: The aviation industry has become a crucial part of the global economy, contributing to trade, tourism, and job creation. In a world without airplanes, the economy would likely be more localized, with a greater emphasis on ground and sea transportation.
Cultural exchange: Air travel has facilitated the exchange of ideas, cultures, and people across the globe. Without airplanes, cultural exchange would be more limited, potentially leading to a less interconnected and diverse world.
Butterfly effect: Removing such a significant invention from history could have far-reaching and unpredictable consequences. It might alter the course of major historical events, such as wars, migrations, and scientific discoveries, which could drastically change the world as we know it.
Paradoxes: If your actions in the past prevent the invention of the airplane, it raises questions about the consistency of the timeline. Would you still have the knowledge and motivation to travel back in time in a world where airplanes were never invented?

These are just a few potential implications to consider. It's important to remember that the consequences of altering past events can be complex, far-reaching, and often difficult to predict.
What are your thoughts on this scenario? What other aspects or implications do you think are worth exploring?
