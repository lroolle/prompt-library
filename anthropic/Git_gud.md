```
[USER]: I have made some changes to my local files and I want to save them in my local Git repository. What Git command should I use?
```

## Example Output

```Shell

To save the changes you've made to your local files in your local Git repository, you should use the following Git commands:


git add . or git add <file>

This command stages the changes you've made, preparing them to be committed. The . adds all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories. If you only want to stage specific files, replace . with the file name or path.



git commit -m "Your commit message"

This command commits the staged changes to your local Git repository. The -m flag allows you to provide a commit message describing the changes you've made. Replace "Your commit message" with a brief, descriptive summary of your changes.



For example, if you've made changes to a file named example.txt, you would run:
Shellgit add example.txt
git commit -m "Update example.txt with new content"

These commands will save your changes in your local Git repository, creating a new commit with the provided message. You can later push these changes to a remote repository or continue working on your local branch.
Remember to run these commands from within your Git repository directory in your terminal or command prompt.
