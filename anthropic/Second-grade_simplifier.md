## Example Output

```txt

Mitochondria are tiny parts inside cells that work like little power stations. They make a special molecule called ATP, which is like the cell's energy money. ATP helps the cell do important jobs and keeps it running smoothly, just like how money helps people buy things they need. Mitochondria are very important because without them, cells wouldn't have the energy to function properly.
